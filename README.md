This is a javascript number puzzle built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Pure Javascript. The goal of the game is to arrange the numbers in increasing order starting from zero. The number of rows and columns can be modified (2>= rows and columns <=5). The number of moves made will also be displayed.

Inspiration from my friend, [Gowtham's repo](https://github.com/gowtham1582000). Thanks bud!
